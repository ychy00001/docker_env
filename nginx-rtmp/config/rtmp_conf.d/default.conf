    # HLS

    # For HLS to work please create a directory in tmpfs (/tmp/hls here)
    # for the fragments. The directory contents is served via HTTP (see
    # http{} section in config)
    #
    # Incoming stream must be in H264/AAC. For iPhones use baseline H264
    # profile (see ffmpeg example).
    # This example creates RTMP stream from movie ready for HLS:
    #
    # ffmpeg -loglevel verbose -re -i movie.avi  -vcodec libx264
    #    -vprofile baseline -acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 -ac 1
    #    -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/hls/movie
    #
    # If you need to transcode live stream use 'exec' feature.
    #
    application hls {
         live on;
         hls on;
         hls_path /var/www/hls;

    # # MPEG-DASH is similar to HLS
    # #
    # application dash {
    #     live on;
    #     dash on;
    #     dash_path /tmp/dash;
    # }
}
